Drawn to Virtual Life Instructions:

Before use, the MATLAB Image Processing Toolbox and the App Designer feature is
required (only available in MATLAB versions beyond 2015). 

To simulate the drawing robot, open the drawtolife.mlapp application to 
activate the GUI. 

Choose from a selection of 4 preset image options on the GUI, or upload your 
own PNG or JPG for the robot to process. After you are done selecting the image, 
click "Draw" and see the robot draw the image to virtual life!

The robot is best at drawing images with solid color fill and clear boundaries,
that can be easily recognizable as a black and white image. 

The preset image files are not our own. Due to copyright law, do not attempt 
to commercialize the drawings of the robot though the robot appreciates your
approval of its life's work.
